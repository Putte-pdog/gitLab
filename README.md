# EDAN10 Lab 3: Git
In this lab, we are going to try git and evaluate its pros and cons.

## Procedure of part one
The following commands should be evaluated:

### Working alone
When working alone, we want to be masters of the following commands
- status
- diff
- branching
- merging
- add
- commit
- push

Can we add files? Can we delete files? Can we create new files? Can we rename files?

### Working in parallel
Try the different scenarios of working in parallel. Same scenarios as prev labs.

### Creating releases
Can we create releases in git? Since it is a DCVS, how does this affect release tagging?

## Procedure of part two
Exotic and new features of git to try out and understand:
- rebase
- rebase -squash
- fetch vs pull
- apply vs cherrypick

## Questions to think of
- your opinion/evaluation of git/DVCS
- how well does git support merge tracking?
- does git support strict long transactions?
- does git support the composition model and the change set model?
- what does the git concept fast-forward mean – and why does it exist?
- what does git stash do – and when could it be useful?
- what happens if you pull something and you have local uncommitted changes?
- what could happen if you were allowed to push something to another person’s repository?
