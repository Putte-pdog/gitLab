git status
we can type git status anywhere in the repo and get information about what branc we are in, what state we are in and what files are tracked/not tracked lastly we can see what files has changed.

git diff
when we run git diff we get a report of all the local changes made since latest commit. We can also specify a single dir or file to diff against.

moreover we can use diff like such:
git diff pointer..pointer

where pointer can be a branch name or commit name. This will generate differences between the two snapshots.

git branch
we can list all local branches using git branch.

git checkout
will change from current workspace to a snapshot of commit or branch. Use git branch -b [name] to create a new branch with name [name]

git merge
with merge, we can specify a branch to merge from, into *this branch*. You will find out what *this branch* is from git status and you change branch with git checkout

git add

git commit

git push

git pull
